# electricity-demand-forecasting
A machine learning project predicting electricity usage trends with seasonal and trend-based models.
This project focuses on forecasting monthly electricity consumption using historical data from **January 1973 to December 2019**. The primary objective is to build robust time series models that can accurately predict electricity demand for the upcoming year(s), aiding energy providers in planning and resource optimization.

Project Objectives :
Understand the trend and seasonality in electricity usage.
Perform time series decomposition and stationarity checks.
Build and evaluate forecasting models:
ETS (Error, Trend, Seasonal)**
SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA)**
Compare model performance using error metrics.
Forecast electricity consumption for the year 2019.
